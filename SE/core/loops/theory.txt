A loop in C is a control structure that allows the execution of a block of code multiple times based on a condition. It helps in performing repetitive tasks efficiently without writing the same code repeatedly.

Loops are useful for tasks like iterating over an array, summing a series of numbers, or processing each character in a string. For example, to print numbers from 1 to 10, a loop can be used instead of writing multiple printf statements.

In C, there are three primary types of loops:

• For Loop: Iterates over a range of values and is useful when the number of iterations is known.

    A for loop in C is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly. It's especially useful for scenarios where the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement, which manage the loop's execution.
    
    syntax:

    for(starting_point ; condition_for_ending_point ; starting_point_update){
        //code to be executed
    }

    for (initialization; condition; update-initialization(inc/dec)) {
        // code to be executed
    }   

• While Loop: Continues executing as long as a specified condition remains true.

    A while loop in C is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition. It continues to execute as long as the condition remains true, and it is particularly useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

    
    syntax:

    while (condition){
        //code to be executed
    }

• Do-While Loop: Executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition.
    syntax:

    do{
        //code to be executed
    }while(condition)
