What is identifiers in python?

# Your answer is:

Identifiers are the names used to identify entities such as variables, functions, classes, modules, and other objects in a programming language. They follow certain rules and conventions to ensure readability and maintainability of the code.


Rulse:

1. Identifiers can contain letters, digits (0-9), or underscores (_).
2. Identifiers must start with a letter (A-Z, a-z) or an underscore (_).
3. Identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning "Hello" and "hello" are different identifiers.
4. Some common identifiers that are reserved for future use include:
    - `False`, `None`, `True`
    - `and`, `as`, `assert`, `break`, `class`, `continue`, `def`, `del`, `elif`, `else`, `except`, `finally`, `for`, `from`, `global`, `if`, `import`, `in`, `is`, `lambda`, `nonlocal`, `not`, `or`, `pass`, `raise`, `return`, `try`, `while`, `with`, `yield`
    - `True`, `False`, `None` are constants that represent logical values.
5. special symbols are not allowd. Example: @gsjg, $jhkjuhf
6. white-space are not allowed Example: first name
